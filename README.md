# Part-1---Data-Analysis-using-Pandas
 

A data scientist was walking through the garden when he noticed some lovely flowers on the other side of him. He observed some of them while walking because they had slight similarities. He began to gather information about these species after getting the idea that he could analyze these flowers. He identified specifics, such as species that are from the same family, the Iridaceae. He gathered data on petal length, width, and sepal and sepal width measurements.

In order to use the data to create a predictive model, it must be collected, combined, organized, and structured. Once the data has been correctly organized into a data frame. He looks for any missing or null values before replacing them with zero or previous data. He carries out some of the operations, including adding sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width by species, calculating mean sepal length, determining minimum petal width, etc.

# About the dataset

The Iris flower data set or Fisherâ€™s Iris data set is one of the most famous multivariate data sets used for testing various Machine Learning Algorithms. The dataset contains 150 rows  6 columns set of 50 records under 5 attributes are:

Sepal length: Length of sepal in cms. 
Sepal width: Width of sepal in cms. 
Petal length: Length of petal in cms.
Petal width: Width of petal in cms.
Species class: Classes are Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour, and Iris virginica(types of flower).

# Expected outcomes

As a data science enthusiast, you have some tasks to perform on the provided dataset such as: 

Importing the dataset. 
View the data.
Extract data using the index function, 
Checking for missing values, replacing them with appropriate data, and 
Performing operations on these tables such as find mean sepal length, 
Find minimum petal width, 
Find the sum of sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width by species, etc.
